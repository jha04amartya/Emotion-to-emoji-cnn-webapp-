# Emotion_To_Emoji
# PROJECT AIM:Our project aims to develop a model which takes the video of a person as an input and displays the emotion using an emoji. This model uses deep learning concepts to recognize the emotion of one or multiple person at a time .
# To access our project , you have to first download jupyter notebook and python on your device .
# download the dataset using this link  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013 
# then download the codes : MODEL.ipynb has the code for training the model and opencv.ipynb has the code for using opencv and flask framework
# then you have to download the pre-trained models if you dont want to train it by yourself , the links are provided in the end the of spec doc and when and where to use them is specified in the code in the form of comments .
# also you have to download the emoji folder uploaded and also have to update the path of emoji from our code to yours
# finally you need to run the openCV.ipynb file after updating all paths, you will get an address of a web app, copy that address and open it in a new window
# rest instructions are provided in the code in the form of comments
